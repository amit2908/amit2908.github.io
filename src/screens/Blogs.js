<p>What is multithreading?</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Multithreading is a way of managing multiple tasks on the available threads in an efficient way so that the application remains seamless and responsive to the user.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>What is a thread?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads.</p>
<br/>
<p>What is a process?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A process is an instance of a computer program. In simple terms, any executing program is known as a process.</p>
<p>A process can use multiple threads to complete a tasks mentioned in its program.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>Difference between a thread and a process</p>
<p></p>
<p>A thread is a lightweight process. Multiple threads can share same memory within a process. While multiple processes doesnâ€™t share memory with each other.</p>

<p>Multithreading in iOS</p>
<p></p>
<p>iOS provides two APIs to achieve multithreading.</p>
<p>1. GCD (Grand Central Dispatch):  is a low-level api and is an implementation of libDispatch library.</p>
<p>2. NSOperationQueue: is built on top of GCD which provides an object oriented approach to achieve multithreading.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Generally, there are two types of queues:</p>
<p>1. Serial Queue</p>
<p>2. Concurrent Queue</p>
<p></p>
<p>A queue is a FIFO type data structure. Therefore the tasks added first to the queue will be dispatched first.</p>
<p>Note that FIFO concept applies to only dispatching of the task and not to its execution.</p>
